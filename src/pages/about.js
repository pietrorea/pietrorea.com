      <h1>About</h1>

      <p>
        Hello üëã, my name is Pietro Rea and I am a software engineer and
        sometimes engineering manager. Right now I am the Head of Engineering
        and co-founder of{" "}
        <a href="https://www.meadowfi.com?utm_source=pietrorea.com?utm_medium=organic">
          Meadow
        </a>
        . Our mission is to empower students financially, and promote economic
        mobility through higher education.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over the years I‚Äôve discovered that I am a{" "}
        <a href="https://medium.com/@sherifmansour/product-engineers-f424da766871">
          product engineer
        </a>
        , which means I engage with the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù, build MLPs (minimum lovable
        products) and pair up well with product, UX and design.
      </p>

      <h2>Some of my previous work</h2>

      <p>
        Previously, I&#39;ve held a number of engineering positions across many
        industries including travel, e-commerce and media. I was part of Capital
        One's mobile engineering team, where I helped build digital tools for
        Capital One's credit card customers. Before that, I was a team lead at{" "}
        <a href="https://upside.com">Upside Business Travel</a>, where I led
        teams of software engineers to build and maintain Upside's profile and
        authentication systems, Upside's corporate offering and the iOS and
        Android apps.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        Prior to joining Upside, I spent a couple of years on Sweetpea Mobile, a
        consultancy I started, where I helped startups like{" "}
        <a href="https://www.gc.com">GameChanger</a> and{" "}
        <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/27/spotify-acquires-content-recommendation-startup-mightytv/">
          MightyTV
        </a>{" "}
        with their mobile apps. I operated as an agency for almost two years
        until I ramped down operations in 2017.
      </p>

      <p>
        And before that, I was a mobile engineer at{" "}
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diapers.com">Quidsi</a>, a
        subsidiary of Amazon and the parent company for Diapers.com, Soap.com
        and several other brands. Back then, we mastered the art of ‚Äúone-handed
        shopping‚Äù, shipping five-star iOS and Android apps that enabled parents
        to get all their shopping done with one hand while having an infant in
        the other. Finally, before Quidsi I worked at the{" "}
        <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com">Huffington Post</a> in New York
        City where I built news and video apps.
      </p>

      <p>
        I hold a bachelor‚Äôs degree in Economics from Princeton University. I
        decided on my major after reading{" "}
        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Worldly-Philosophers-Economic-Thinkers-Seventh/dp/068486214X">
          The Worldly Philosophers
        </a>{" "}
        by Robert Heilbroner, although I spent most of my time at Princeton
        studying Chinese and Computer Science. ‰Ω†Â•Ω!
      </p>

      <p>
        I sometimes write books and articles, mostly about software development
        on Apple platforms.
